 · A Hacked Client has a "Server Crash" function implemented, which spams "CUSTOM_PAYLOAD"-Packets (using minecraft's book channels) with max size. The NCP packet frequency check doesn't block it, because it doesn't spam that much packets, but really big ones. This makes the server lag really hard and finally crash.  · Hacked Clients crashing minecraft I do not know what is happening but i am trying to install a hacked client on version and my minecraft crashes every time, i have deleted the game re downloaded, aft and re downloaded and still crashes. I've updated Java and any update my pc needs to do but it still keeps crashing.  · Server crashes at Don't mind the skin.
