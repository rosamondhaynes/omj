Minecraft "Hack" client list Sigma  Wurst  Aristois  Meteor  Impact  Inertia  Salhack  Ares  KamiBlue. I have only listed clients that are well known and in my opinion are safe. I do not own any of these clients I am simply providing the official download . Currently they are known as "Rift" I have no idea what is week.#'s new alt but it is named Rift and the server's name is "Rift alts" He also repeatedly claimed that he didnt own rythem alts. In a more recent dm, he said that he owned rythem alts.
