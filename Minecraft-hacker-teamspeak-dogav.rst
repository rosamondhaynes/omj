In most cases TeamSpeak is not "Hacked" but instead somebody has logged into your server claiming to be staff that was not and talked another staff member into giving them a rank. To avoid this you should limit the number of staff members that have the ability to give ranks to others and you should never give a rank without knowing for sure who it is.
